# Telecom-Churn-EDA
This repository contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) for a telecommunications company's customer churn dataset. The dataset includes customer demographics, usage patterns, and services subscribed. The goal of this analysis is to identify patterns and trends in the data that could help predict which customers are most likely to churn.

### Dataset 
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from a telecommunications company and contains customer information, including demographic data such as age, gender, and income, as well as data on their usage patterns and services subscribed. The dataset consists of a total of X observations and Y variables.

### Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Seaborn
Matplotlib

### Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
data/: Contains the raw data used for the analysis.
notebooks/: Contains the Jupyter Notebook used to perform the EDA.
results/: Contains the visualizations generated during the EDA process.

### How to Use
To run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:
Clone this repository.
Install the necessary libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Open the Jupyter Notebook Telecom Churn Analysis (EDA).ipynb in the notebooks/ directory.
Run the cells in the notebook to reproduce the analysis.

### Conclusion
In this project, we performed an EDA on a telecommunications company's customer churn dataset. The analysis helped identify patterns and trends in the data that could be useful for predicting which customers are most likely to churn. Further work can be done to build a predictive model and deploy it as a web application or API.
